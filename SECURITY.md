# Security Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

At [Project Name], we take the security of our software seriously. We appreciate the help of the security community and encourage responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities you may find.

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Submit a Report**: Send an email to our security team at security@projectname.com. Please provide the following information:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected component or feature.
   - Any relevant technical details or proof-of-concept code to demonstrate the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if applicable.
   - Your contact information, including your name and email address.

2. **Encryption**: When sending the email, encrypt it using our [PGP public key](link_to_pgp_key) to ensure the confidentiality of the information shared.

3. **Response**: Our security team will acknowledge your report within [timeframe]. We will work with you to validate the vulnerability and take appropriate actions.

4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We kindly request that you refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it and release a security patch. We strive for a coordinated disclosure process to protect our users and give them time to update their systems.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

As a security researcher, we expect you to adhere to the following principles:

- **Do not exploit or share the vulnerability with others**: Once you have reported the vulnerability to us, please do not exploit it further or disclose it to anyone until we have addressed the issue.

- **Do not modify or access user data without explicit permission**: If your testing or investigation requires access to user data, ensure that you have obtained explicit permission from the affected users and do not perform any unauthorized actions.

- **Do not disrupt or degrade our services**: Please avoid any actions that may negatively impact the availability or performance of our services or cause harm to other users.

- **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have resolved it**: We request that you give us sufficient time to investigate and remediate the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We will work together to agree on an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Recognition and Reward

As a token of appreciation for your responsible disclosure, we are happy to recognize and acknowledge your contribution. Depending on the severity and impact of the vulnerability, we may also offer a monetary reward or bug bounty as a gesture of thanks.

We value your efforts in helping us maintain the security of our project and protect our users. Thank you for your cooperation and support.
